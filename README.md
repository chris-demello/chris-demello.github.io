The following link below is my code review. This showcases the original project that was developed in CS360. The review starts with running the application and showing how the weight lost tracking application works. From a login screen to inputting daily weight entries, it displays a simple program. The next step reviews the issues with the functionality that'll need to be addressed. Following this, each class is reviewed and commented on how I can improve the existing code as well as incorporate the three new enhancements.
